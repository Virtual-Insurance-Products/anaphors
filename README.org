#+TITLE: Simple Common Lisp Anaphor Macros

* Anaphors
This package contains 2 very simple anaphoric macros in Common Lisp:
~aif~ and ~awhen~. As described in [[http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisptext.html][On Lisp]] by Paul Graham. I've only
implemented those 2 though - not the other ones he implemented. 

You're probably better off using https://github.com/tokenrove/anaphora
than this library, but I wrote this before I knew of that, and it's
trivial.
